**Hostel Accommodation System**
This repository contains a simple C++ program for managing hostel accommodation and student records. The program includes two classes:

**Hostel:** Represents a hostel with attributes such as name, rent, and available beds. It allows reserving beds and updates the hostel data file accordingly.

**Student:** Represents a student with attributes like name, roll number, and address. It allows adding student records to a file.

**Features:**

Hostel data (name, rent, beds) is saved to a file (Hostel.txt).
Students can reserve beds if available, and their details are stored in another file (Student.txt).
Basic console menu interface for user interaction.

**Files Included:**
main.cpp: Contains the main program with the Hostel and Student classes, along with the main function for user interaction.
Hostel.txt: Stores hostel data.
Student.txt: Stores student records.
